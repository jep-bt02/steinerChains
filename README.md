# steinerChains
Complex analysis mini project - Octave

This code generates a Steiner chain of "n" circles and uses a MÃ¶bius transformation to generate a mapping in the complex plain through a center of inversion and a set of rescaling parameters. Central circle is the unit circle.  

The arangement of the circles and their radius in the Steiner chain is:
O---(r_internal)---(r_external)---(r)---(R)
